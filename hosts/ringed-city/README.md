# ringed-city

`ringed-city` is my work MacBook.

## Introduction

I use [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to do most of the heavy lifting for my dotfiles.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maxdeviant/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles/hosts/ringed-city
yes | ./install
home-manager switch
```
