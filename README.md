# dotfiles

> ~/ sweet ~/

Welcome to my [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles) repository!

# Structure

Here is a breakdown of the structure of the repository:

- [`hosts`](./hosts) contains the dotfiles for my different hosts
  - [`firelink`](./hosts/firelink) is my tower running NixOS
- [`nixos`](./nixos) contains my NixOS configuration
  - This is currently based on `firelink` but will eventually be made system-agnostic
- [`archive`](./archive) contains my old dotfiles from previous systems. These may go away at some point in the future
